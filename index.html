    <--Hey there! I'm Jarom, a college student currently diving into the world of communications with an emphasis in
    public relations. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me lost in the pages of a good book myself or 
    whipping up something delicious in the kitchen—I absolutely love cooking and eating good food. Biking is my go-to
    for some outdoor fun, and I also have a soft spot for fishing and camping. Sudoku is my brain-teasing go-to, and
    I enjoy expressing myself through drawing. Currently on the lookout for a job, I'm excited about the next chapter
    and the opportunities that come my way!-->
