                <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
                <p>
                    Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river.
                    The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people 
                    living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love 
                    with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.

                    Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep 
                    are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa 
                    pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or 
                    rain when needed.
                    
                    Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest 
                    undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, 
                    and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are 
                    good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the 
                    late summer's slower, warmer water more.

                <h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
                <p>
                    This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. You will never 
                    forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.

                    Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable 
                    river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient 
                    indian ruins accessible only by river.

                    CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X   
                    ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people are familiar with 
                    the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.

                <h2>Highlights from the past season</h2>
                <p>
                    What an incredible season we have had. We celebrated our 50th year of running trips down the Grand Canyon. 
                    This year we ran 36 trips down the Grand Canyon introducing over 800 people to one of our favorite places 
                    on earth. We trained 4 new guides and welcomed them to our family. The season started off with some chilly 
                    weather in the early season, but our guests braved the cold and loved every minute of their trip (show 
                    pictures). Later the temperatures soared reaching highs of 120 F in the Grand canyon and 95 on the Salmon. 
                    We didn't have any trouble getting people in the water at those temperatures.

                <p>Enjoy the breathtaking scenery. From valleys, meadows, canyons, and high peaks; it's way more than just the rapids. It's a great way to get away from it all and relax amongst all the beauty of the great outdoors. </p>
